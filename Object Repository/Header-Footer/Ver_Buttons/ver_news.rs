						How to: travel with passive income 		How to: travel with passive income
‘If traveling was free, you’d never see me again’ 
Probably, all of you have heard this favorite travel quote of all times. We all know that unless you’re ready to quit 9 to 5 job and vagabond around the world, adventures can be quite expensive, especially if you’re travelling abroad.
So how can you pay for travels without being stuck with a job in one place? Here’s a list of ideas that will let you do the round the world trip and not worry about finances.
The first thing you should consider is whether you want to work and travel at the same time or prefer living off passive income, which means that you set up your time and money the way they continue working for you, while you’re not actively involved in earning money.
If you prefer staying on track with your career life, you should definitely consider first option. Especially now, when you don’t necessarily have to work from office. You can be involved in work just the same way, but work from anywhere in world. The only thing you’ll need is a stable internet connection. If your current employer can’t let you work remotely and travel, look for remote position on the Internet. Chances are, that you may find a job you like and be able to see the world. Another way to become a part of the growing community of digital nomads is switching to a freelance career in your professional field. Such choices are widely popular among IT-crowd, but this doesn’t mean that you have to be a software developer to be able to find a remote job.
Another option is finding a so-called backpacker job. These are widely popular in Australia and New Zealand, but it is also possible to find such jobs in North America and Europe too. Such jobs for people who want to travel the world are often offered by local farmers and include fruit picking or just a general help to your host. And if your travel destination is one of the Asian countries, look for English teachers position, same may refer to jobs for travelers in Europe.
But not all of us are willing to work while enjoying the life of an adventurer. For this category of wandering folks, there is another way of paying for their trips: passive income.
Passive income for travelers means that your resources are working for you, not the opposite. What this means is that you need to invest your time and\or money, and they start to generate income on their own.
The examples of such ways of making money can be different. Here’s our own list that may come in handy.
Top-5 passive income ideas:

Investing in stock market

This is a risky one. First of all, you need some knowledge about how stock market works, second – you will need money to invest. The more money – the better. With stock market, your income can grow really fast, but on the other hand, you can also lose everything in a blink of an eye. Especially, if you don’t have any previous experience and skills. Also, this type of income is not entirely passive. You will need to react to the market situation, which is not always convenient when you’re on the road.

Business

Now, any business, of course, requires some of your participation. This may cause a lot of stress and can even kill all the fun and freedom that you get while traveling. But there are some stress-free ways to have passive income with business: you can just buy an existing business, where everything just works, you won’t need to be there the entire time and worry about anything.

Crypto currency mining

If you haven’t heard about Bitcoin and other crypto currencies, you must have spent past two years in the middle of Amazonian jungle. You don’t even have to invest much in buying and selling these crypto coins, another popular way to make passive income with Blockchain technologies is setting up a crypto mining farm. This way you’ll need to invest money only once, unless you want to expand later on.

Real estate

If you have some sort of a real estate property back home, you can rent it and receive the guaranteed monthly pay without having to do pretty much anything. If you are good with planning your travel budget, chances are that you will be able to travel comfortably all year round and live off your rental money.

Royalties

These are pretty obvious in case you have a career in some sort of a creative field. Musicians or video-producers can receive the royalties for their creative products that they sell online. But this doesn’t mean that you have to be a rock-star, composer or an award-winning writer. You can also earn some passive income writing a trip report about your recent journeys. That’s what Route Report offers: you write a detailed report about your travels, including tips and advice for fellow travelers, route maps, photos, etc. The promotion of your report happens without your active involvement. You only need to work once and then receive your royalty each time someone buys your report. The report creator that you will find here(ссылка) makes the work really easy, and you don’t need any superior writing skills. Reports are not fiction, you only need to describe your own adventure and enjoy making profit off travelling.
